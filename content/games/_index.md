## BARBARA {#barbara}

(2021-06-12)

Apart from some snakes and pongs, this is my very first video game. An original IP, so to speak :).
I made this as a birthday gift for a child that never really played a video game before.

Maybe I'll write more about my motivation and the whole process in the future, but for now a couple of hard facts:

-   it was made in [PICO-8](https://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php), which is awesome!
-   it was a **lot** more work than I anticipated!
-   I'm super proud to have finished it!

You can play it [here](/games/barbara/index.html).

## TICKTOCK {#ticktock}

(2021-06-18)

I made TICKTOCK to get to know the awesome [crisp-game-lib](https://github.com/abagames/crisp-game-lib). It's a rather dull and unimaginative game. A typical example of: sounds neat on paper.

Apart from the final outcome, the making of it was well worth it. Like I said, I've gotten more familiar with the _cgl_ and some trigonometric shenanigans, which is always useful.

## DONEWELL {#donewell}

My second [cgl](https://github.com/abagames/crisp-game-lib) game. In my humble opinion, it's actually fun to play. Well done.

## OFFGRID {#offgrid}

(2021-07-31 Sa)

The sound effects makes this one a more rhythmic experience. Depending on the player's speed, it can take a while to get going. But it'll get there :).

## JASMIN {#jasmin}

<div class="verse">

Quarter million, switchin' lanes<br />

</div>

Another birthday, another present. This one is for a person who loves butterflies and elephants. And who thought that every previous game was too difficult. So there you go, have a more tame video game. Happy Birthday!

## HOTSHOT {#hotshot}

(2021-09-30 Do)

One game per month... I barely made it. This one is a _hardcore_ shooter. Hold any button (or press the touchscreen) to charge a shot. Releasing the button will release the shot. You can slow down the laser beam by pressing down again. As always, it's more fun on mobile. Enjoy!
