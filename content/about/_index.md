Hey, I'm Frederic.

I always liked computers, but nowadays I actually _love_ them.

Besides maintaining this private blog, I sometimes write for [MOGWAI LABS](https://mogwailabs.de/en/blog/) &lt;3.

Want to tell me how cheesy those opening quotes are? Did I spread some false information? Or maybe, just maybe, you want to tell me that you've enjoyed one of my things.

In any case, you can write me a [mail](mailto:frederic@gebir.ge) or hit me up on [Mastodon](https://infosec.exchange/@GEBIRGE). I'm looking forward to hear from you!
